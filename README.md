📄 Doc Warehouse – RAG-Based PDF Question Answering System

🚀 Overview                                                                                                                                                                          

Doc Warehouse is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backend system that enables intelligent question answering over uploaded PDF documents.
Users can:

* Upload PDF files
* Convert documents into vector embeddings
* Store them in a FAISS vector database
* Ask natural language questions
* Receive AI-generated answers grounded in the document content
This project demonstrates practical implementation of modern AI backend architecture.
